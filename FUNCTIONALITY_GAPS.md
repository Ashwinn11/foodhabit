# Functionality Gaps vs GutHealth App

## CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES (Phase 1 Priority)

### 1. FOOD LOGGING ⭐
**Current:** Not implemented (Phase 2)
**Needed:** Move to Phase 1
- Log what user ate (multi-select or search database)
- Recently eaten foods for quick re-logging (major engagement driver)
- Shows up in quick log, not separate screen

### 2. WEEKLY CHALLENGE SYSTEM ⭐
**Current:** Not implemented at all
**Needed:** Add immediately
- ONE challenge per week (not daily)
- Example: "Avoid Milk This Week"
- Based on user's potential triggers
- Visual countdown (7 days)
- Reward: +150 Harmony points + badge on completion

### 3. TRANSPARENT SCORING ⭐
**Current:** Vague "harmony points"
**Needed:** Clear metrics
- **Gut Health Score** (Primary): 0-100% (goal: >70%)
  - Calculation: symptom-free days + energy + consistency
- **Bloating Index** (Secondary): 0-100% (goal: <20%)
  - Shows visual progress ring
- Tap to see how score is calculated

### 4. PATTERN INSIGHTS ON HOME SCREEN ⭐
**Current:** Buried in separate "Analysis" screen
**Needed:** Visible on main dashboard
- "You felt great after Salmon (3x)"
- "Bloating peaks on dairy days"
- "Your mood improved when stressed less"
- Real correlations, not buried

### 5. MOOD TRACKING
**Current:** Only stool + energy + symptoms
**Needed:** Add mood wheel
- "How are you feeling?" with 5-8 emoji options
- Sets context for day's data
- Helps explain patterns (stress → bloating)

## WHY THIS MATTERS

GutHealth app succeeds because:
1. **Food logging** = data to find patterns
2. **Weekly challenge** = ONE thing to focus on (not overwhelming)
3. **Transparent scoring** = users understand what they're working toward
4. **Dashboard patterns** = immediate "aha moments" that drive engagement
5. **Mood context** = explains WHY patterns happen

Our app needs these BEFORE fancy animations and mascots.

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

**Week 1:**
- Add mood wheel to home screen
- Add food logging to quick log (with recent foods)
- Create challenge system with weekly assignments

**Week 2:**
- Implement scoring algorithm (Gut Health + Bloating Index)
- Surface pattern insights on dashboard
- Create challenge completion badges

That's it. UI comes after functionality works.
